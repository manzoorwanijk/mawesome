# Contributing

This document is the human-facing guide. [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) is the authoritative
reference for the full command list and the hard rules — please read it too (it applies to
human contributors and AI agents alike).

## Prerequisites

- **Node `>=24.12`** (see `.nvmrc`).
- **pnpm 10** — we do **not** use Corepack. Install pnpm standalone with `npm i -g pnpm@10`,
  the [pnpm install script](https://pnpm.io/installation), or a version manager
  (mise/proto). `devEngines` will error if your Node or pnpm version is wrong.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm verify   # the full local gate
```

### Editor setup (optional)

Recommended VS Code settings are **opt-in**. Install the suggested extensions (VS Code
will prompt from `.vscode/extensions.json`). The recommended settings are installed
automatically: a `.vscode/tasks.json` task runs on **folder open** (once you grant VS Code
Workspace Trust) and copies `.vscode/settings.dist.jsonc` to your local (gitignored)
`.vscode/settings.json` — oxc as the formatter, format-on-save, and tsgo type-checking. You
can also run it manually:

```sh
pnpm vscode:setup
```

It only writes/updates a `settings.json` that still carries the
`@mawesome/managed-vscode-settings` marker, so your personal edits are never overwritten
(delete the marker to take full ownership and opt out of updates).

## Repository layout

- `packages/*` — published `@mawesome/*` packages (each declares all of its own deps).
- `tools/tsconfig` — `@mawesome/tsconfig`, the shared strict TypeScript base.
- `tools/repo` — repo-level dev CLIs (oxlint, oxfmt, syncpack, tsgo) and their configs.
- Root holds **no dependencies** except the `@changesets/*` release tooling (enforced by
  `pnpm check:root-deps`).

## Adding a package

Run `/add-package <name>` (or copy `templates/package/` to `packages/<name>`), then:

1. Set the package `name` to `@mawesome/<name>` and fill in `description`.
2. Declare dependencies as **caret ranges**. If a dependency is already used elsewhere in
   the repo, use the **exact same range** (syncpack enforces one version per dependency —
   `pnpm deps:fix` aligns them). Pick versions already older than the 3-day
   `minimumReleaseAge`. Internal `@mawesome/*` deps use `workspace:*`.
3. `pnpm install`, then `pnpm verify` until green.
4. Add a changeset (below).

## Dependencies

- **syncpack** (`pnpm deps:lint`) enforces that every dependency uses **one identical
  version across the whole repo**, that the ranges are **caret**, and that internal
  `@mawesome/*` deps use `workspace:*`. Run `pnpm deps:fix` to auto-align mismatches.
- Caret ranges let security patches flow in; the committed lockfile pins exact resolved
  versions for reproducibility. (`@typescript/native-preview` is the exception — pinned exact.)
- A new dependency that ships an install/build script will fail `pnpm install`
  (`strictDepBuilds`). If it genuinely needs to build, raise a PR to add it to
  `onlyBuiltDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with justification.

## Changesets / releasing

Every change that affects a **published** package's behavior or public API needs a
changeset. Pure internal/tooling/docs/test changes don't (use `pnpm changeset --empty` only
if a required check demands one).

1. **Create one:** `pnpm changeset`. Select the affected `@mawesome/*` package(s), pick the
   bump — **patch** (fix), **minor** (backward-compatible feature), **major** (breaking;
   note `0.x` minors are still breaking under semver) — and write a clear, user-facing
   summary. It becomes the package's changelog entry. Commit the generated file in
   `.changeset/`.
2. **Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`** — changesets generates it.
3. **Release flow:** merges to `main` accumulate changesets. The `changesets/action`
   opens/updates a **"Version Packages"** PR that bumps versions and writes changelogs.
   Merging _that_ PR publishes the changed packages via npm **OIDC trusted publishing** (no
   tokens). The first publish of a brand-new package name may need a one-time manual
   `npm publish` / npm UI setup to create the name before the trusted-publisher link exists.
4. Internal `@mawesome/*` dependents are bumped automatically
   (`updateInternalDependencies: patch`).
